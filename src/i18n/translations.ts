            q: 'Why do Florida golf cart paths get slippery?',

          q: '¿Tienen que cerrar el campo o bloquear el acceso a los senderos?',
          a: 'En muchos casos, no. Nuestro sistema autónomo se mueve a lo largo del sendero sin mangueras extendidas por el campo. La programación depende de las operaciones de su instalación y los requisitos de seguridad.'

          q: '¿Cómo reduce el sistema de circuito cerrado el uso de agua?',
          a: 'El agua de lavado se recupera y reutiliza como parte de un proceso de circuito cerrado, reduciendo significativamente la escorrentía y el consumo general de agua en comparación con el lavado a presión tradicional.'

          q: '¿Necesitan acceso al agua en la propiedad?',

        {
          q: '¿Su equipo cabe en nuestros senderos?',

          q: '¿Qué pasa con el moho y las algas que vuelven?',

          q: '¿Qué superficies pueden limpiar?',
